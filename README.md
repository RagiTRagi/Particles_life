# Project Idea:

A Python software application that simulates a **dynamic particle system** in which thousands of particles interact based on predefined rules. The **simulation** should include different particle types with unique properties and interaction patterns, demonstrating emergent behavior and visual complexity. 

# Tasks:

Developing a project - *Biology-inspired algorithms - emergent behavior* - for the <br> HSD Course: *Data Science und KI Infrastrukturen, Wintersemester 2025-2026* <br> Supervised by Prof. Dr. Florian Huber
