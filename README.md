# Project Idea:

A Python software application that simulates a **dynamic particle system** in which thousands of particles interact based on predefined rules. The **simulation** should include different particle types with unique properties and interaction patterns, demonstrating emergent behavior and visual complexity. 

# User Guide

## Requirements

 - Python 3.9+
 - Install dependecies: 
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run the App
 From the project Root:
 ```python main.py```
 This starts the particle simulation UI.

## Controls 

- Click a matrix button to select a particle Interaction
- Use the slider to adjust the selected Interaction strength.
- Adjust friction and noise with the spin boxes
- Use Pause/Resume to stop and continue the simulation
- To Reset the Positions of the Particles use the Reset Button

## Troubleshooting 

- If the UI does not open, verfiy you meet the requirements above
- Make sure to run the command from the project root
